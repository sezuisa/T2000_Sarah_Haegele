- The CIF-12 branch needs the following for a successful build:
    - planStatus mustn't be asserted in the tests since it doesn't exist in Cmd 12
    - Integration tests for nms create, update, delete have to be ignored (possibly via a ExecutionCondition) while the bug with the HTTP 500 "POST not allowed" is still present in Cmd 12
