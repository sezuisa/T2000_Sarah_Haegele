- Device Master Query needs to work for every possible entity. It needs a "function" query restriction, this is sometimes equal to the command ID of the entity, but also sometimes not (e.g. Cabinet Supplies is CABINET_SUPPLY instead of CABINET_SUPPLIES).
    -> Maybe there's some way to query the available options from the dropdown field and match one to the entity? (Maybe ask Ruben)

- The CIF-12 branch needs the following for a successful build:
    - planStatus mustn't be asserted in the tests since it doesn't exist in Cmd 12
    - Integration tests for nms create, update, delete have to be ignored (possibly via a ExecutionCondition) while the bug with the HTTP 500 "POST not allowed" is still present in Cmd 12
